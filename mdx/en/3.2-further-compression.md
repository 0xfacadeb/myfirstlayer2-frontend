# 3.2 Further Compression

Data compression isn't new and predates blockchain technology. Beyond the customized compression strategies mentioned earlier, numerous compression algorithms can be employed to further minimize data size. 

For instance, in everyday situations, we often encounter compressed files like zip, rar, and 7z, which use compression algorithms to shrink various file sizes. Similarly, Optimism utilizes the Zlib compression algorithm, while Arbitrum employs the Brotli compression algorithm.

When evaluating the currently active Layer 2 Rollup solutions, it's clear they have achieved significant compression results compared to the Ethereum mainnet.
